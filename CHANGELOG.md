# Changelog: rich-click

## Version 0.1.2

- Seems to work fine on Python 3.6, so dropped the requirement down to this instead of Python 3.7

## Version 0.1.1

- Fix a bug in `setup.cfg` that broke installation

## Version 0.1.0

Initial development version of `rich-click`, mostly as a proof of concept.

Supports basic generic functionality for printing help from click commands and groups.

Code was initially written by [@willmcgugan](https://github.com/willmcgugan) for `rich-cli`
and then further developed by [@ewels](http://github.com/ewels/).
